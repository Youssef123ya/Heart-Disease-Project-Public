# Heart Disease Project
Comprehensive Machine Learning Full Pipeline on Heart Disease UCI Dataset Final project @ Sprints x Microsoft Summer Camp - AI and Machine Learning.

## Comprehensive Machine Learning Full Pipeline on Heart Disease UCI Dataset
1. Objectives:
- Perform Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (handle missing values, encoding, scaling).
- Apply Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) to retain essential features.
- Implement Feature Selection using statistical methods and ML-based techniques.
- Train Supervised Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) for classification.
- Apply Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for pattern discovery.
- Optimize Models using Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).
- Deploy a Streamlit UI for real-time user interaction. [Bonus]
- Host the application using Ngrok [Bonus] and upload the project to GitHub for accessibility.
2. Tools to be Used:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (optional).
- Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Selection: PCA, RFE, Chi-Square Test.
- Supervised Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.
- Unsupervised Models: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.
- Model Optimization: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.
- Deployment Tools: Streamlit [Bonus], Ngrok [Bonus], GitHub.
